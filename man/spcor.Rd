\title{
Semi-partial (part) correlation
}
\description{
The function \code{spcor} can calculate the pairwise semi-partial (part) correlations for each pair of variables given others. In addition, it gives us the p value as well as statistic for each pair of variables.
}
\usage{
spcor(x, method = c("pearson", "kendall", "spearman"))
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{
a matrix or data fram. 
}
  \item{method}{
a character string indicating which semi-partial (part) correlation coefficient is to be computed. One of "pearson" (default), "kendall", or "spearman" can be abbreviated.
}
}
\details{
Semi-partial correlation is the correlation of two variables with variation from a third or more other variables removed only from the second variable.
}
\value{
\item{estimate}{a matrix of the semi-partial (part) correlation coefficient between two variables}
\item{p.value}{a matrix of the p value of the test}
\item{statistic}{a matrix of the value of the test statistic}
\item{n}{the number of samples}
\item{gn}{the number of given variables}
\item{method}{the correlation method used}
