\title{
Partial correlation
}
\description{
The function \code{pcor} can calculate the pairwise partial correlations for each pair of variables given others. In addition, it gives us the p value as well as statistic for each pair of variables.
}
\usage{
pcor(x, method = c("pearson", "kendall", "spearman"))
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{
a matrix or data fram. 
}
  \item{method}{
a character string indicating which partial correlation coefficient is to be computed. One of "pearson" (default), "kendall", or "spearman" can be abbreviated.
}
}
\details{
Partial correlation is the correlation of two variables while controlling for a third or more other variables. When the determinant of variance-covariance matrix is numerically zero, Moore-Penrose generalized matrix inverse is used. In this case, no \code{p-value} and \code{statistic} will be provided if the number of variables are greater than or equal to the sample size.
}
\value{
\item{estimate}{a matrix of the partial correlation coefficient between two variables}
\item{p.value}{a matrix of the p value of the test}
\item{statistic}{a matrix of the value of the test statistic}
\item{n}{the number of samples}
\item{gn}{the number of given variables}
\item{method}{the correlation method used}
