\title{
Semi-partial (part) correlation for two variables given a third variable.
}
\description{
The function \code{spcor.test} can calculate the pairwise semi-partial (part) correlations between two variables. In addition, it gives us the p value as well as statistic.
}
\usage{
spcor.test(x, y, z, method = c("pearson", "kendall", "spearman"))
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{
a numeric vector.
}
  \item{y}{
a numeric vector.
}
  \item{z}{
a numeric vector.
}
  \item{method}{
a character string indicating which partial correlation coefficient is to be computed. One of "pearson" (default), "kendall", or "spearman" can be abbreviated.
}
}
\details{
Semi-partial correlation is the correlation of two variables with variation from a third variable removed only from the second variable. When the determinant of variance-covariance matrix is numerically zero, Moore-Penrose generalized matrix inverse is used. In this case, no \code{p-value} and \code{statistic} will be provided if the number of variables are greater than or equal to the sample size.
}
\value{
\item{estimate}{the semi-partial (part) correlation coefficient between two variables}
\item{p.value}{the p value of the test}
\item{statistic}{the value of the test statistic}
\item{n}{the number of samples}
\item{gn}{the number of given variables}
\item{method}{the correlation method used}
